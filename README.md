# ValhallaMMO-Bedrock-Texture-Pack

The texture pack is now available for bedrock players of this immersive MMO-inspired plugin, where you can craft new weapons such as a dagger or a spear, use a wide range of amulets and craft tools within its special crafting system!

The texture pack is made up of the following components:

- All the textures of the plugin's item icons
- All new weapons plugin with 3D textures
- Animated textures for crafting materials (such as unstable diamond, etc.)
- All weapons and items in the texture pack are compatible with the secondary hand in bedrock!

Things I may add in the future (I don't promise anything!):

- Customized java texture pack interface for the skills, crafting and amulets menus
- Add some particles from the plugin to the bedrock texture pack

# How can I install the texture pack?

First, you will need the GeyserMC plugin, which allows Java and Bedrock players to play on the same server. Without this plugin you will not be able to use the texture pack.

When you have the plugin installed, you will have to enter to the `geyser_mappings` folder, that is inside the `/plugins/Geyser-Spigot` folder, where you will have to upload
the geyser_mappings file from above. Afterwards, you must download the following texture packs and upload them to the geyser packs folder.

Finally, turn on the server and accept the file download that will appear when you are logging in, and you will be able to enjoy a better ValhallaMMO experience with its special textures!
